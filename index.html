          August Zang, an Austrian artillery officer, is credited with bringing
          the croissant to France when he opened his own Viennese bakery in
          Paris.

          The Croissant started as a luxury product, but by the end of the
          nineteenth century, it was middle-class (the rich preferred a good
          brioche).

          The chocolate croissant is actually called painauchocolat, as it is
          not in the shape of a crescent.

          In 2013, chef Dominque Ansel came up with the cronut. It is a
          deep-fried croissant/doughnut combination that became all the rage at
          his New York bakery.
